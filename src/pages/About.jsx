          Hi, I'm <strong>Leonard Nketia Obempong</strong>, the creator of CivicConnect.
          My vision is to empower citizens to take an active role in improving their
          communities. By reporting civic issues such as sanitation, security, and infrastructure,
          we can create a cleaner, safer, and more efficient society together.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          CivicConnect is more than a platform â€” it's a movement to bridge the gap between
          citizens and authorities, ensuring accountability and faster problem resolution.
